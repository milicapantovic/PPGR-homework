# APGC homework

Homework tasks for the course of The application of projective geometry in computing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  

Install the required packages with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```
##  Features

*Compute camera matrices, including intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.*

*Perform camera calibration to estimate camera orientation and position.*

*Use projective transformations to remove projective distortion.*

*Calculate coordinates of the invisible box vertex.*

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder of the task you want to run.

2. Prepare the necessary input data (2D points, images, calibration patterns).

3. Run the Python scripts for the specific task, for example:
```bash
python3 testing.py
```

**Outputs may include camera matrices, 3D points, or visualizations depending on the task.**
